For new datasets
1. roslaunch playback_generate_map.launch
2. roslaunch playback_generate_trayectory.launch

[1] Uses gmapping to create a new map. At the end use 
    rosrun map_server map_saver
[2] Saves the variables using pickle so localization algorithm can use it. Slam implementations, obviously, do not need these pickled files. To save run
    rostopic pub -1 /save std_msgs/String h
